## üìÇ Implemented Algorithms

### **Symmetric Encryption**

* **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)** ‚Äî Secure block cipher with multiple modes (CBC, GCM, etc.).
* **RC4** ‚Äî Stream cipher (legacy; insecure for modern use).

### **Asymmetric Encryption**

* **RSA** ‚Äî Public-key encryption for secure communication and digital signatures.
* **Diffie-Hellman** ‚Äî Secure key exchange protocol.

### **Elliptic Curve Cryptography**

* **ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography)** ‚Äî Efficient public-key encryption.
* **ECC + AES Hybrid** ‚Äî ECC for key exchange, AES for fast encryption.

### **Hashing**

* **SHA** ‚Äî Secure hash algorithms (SHA-256).

### **Digital Signatures**

* **Digital Signature** ‚Äî Using RSA or ECC to sign and verify messages.
